**Knowledgeable-r1** is an effective strategy for the RL training of LLMs that using joint sampling and define multi policy distributions in knowledge capability exploration to stimulate large language modelsâ€™ self-integrated utilization of parametric and contextual knowledge. Experiments show that Knowledgeable-r1 significantly enhances robustness and reasoning accuracy in both parameters and contextual conflict tasks and general RAG tasks, especially outperforming baselines in counterfactual scenarios and demonstrating consistent gains across RAG tasks.

ðŸŽ¯ **Key Benefits**:
- **No additional cost** â€” only the rollout strategy and RL objective is modified 
- **Easy to adopt** â€” no additional components or complex multiple prompt pipelines are required in application  
- **Superior generalization** â€” Knowledgeable-r1 significantly enhances robustness and reasoning accuracy in both parameters and contextual conflict tasks and general RAG tasks


## ðŸ™Œ Environment
The runtime environment is in the requirements.txt
so you can
``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
At least two GPUs are needed.

## Usage
Run the following command:
``` bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=7 python ref_server.py
```
This just uses one GPU to collect and run the reference model.

In *config.py*, set the generation device index â€‹relative to the visible devicesâ€‹ in next step:
``` bash
gen_device = 0
```
Then, open another bash:
``` bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1,2,3,4,5,6 deepspeed grpo_program.py
```
